# Analysing Ultra-Marathon Trends in the USA (2020)

## Project Overview
I analysed an extensive dataset of ultra-marathon race records to uncover trends, patterns, and insights into athlete performance, demographics, and event characteristics. 

## Dataset
Contains over 7 million Ultra-marathon race records (1798-2022).
Retrieved from Kaggle.

## Project Objectives
* Transform and refine the large-scale dataset (7.5 million+ records) to ensure data quality, accuracy, and readability.
* Uncover key trends and patterns in ultra-marathon participation and performance, examining factors such as age, gender, distance, and athlete speed.

## Key Findings
* **Gender Comparison:** Males tend to perform better than females in both 50km and 50 mile races, with higher average speeds.
* **Age Group Performance:** Athletes who are 29 years old are the fastest age group, among ultramarathoners who have done at least 20 races. This suggests that 29 is the prime age for participating in ultramarathons.
* **Race Length and Gender**: The histogram shows an almost equal distribution of male and female participants in 50km races but more male participants than female participants in 50mile races.

  
## Methodology
* Utilised **Pandas** to filter dataset, remove unnecessary columns and handle missing values
* Utilised **Seaborn** for data visualisation
